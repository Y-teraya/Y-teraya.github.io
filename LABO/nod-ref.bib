  abstract  = {Nitrogen is generally considered one of the major limiting nutrients in plant growth. The biological process responsible for reduction of molecular nitrogen into ammonia is referred to as nitrogen fixation. A wide diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacterial species belonging to most phyla of the Bacteria domain have the capacity to colonize the rhizosphere and to interact with plants. Leguminous and actinorhizal plants can obtain their nitrogen by association with rhizobia or Frankia via differentiation on their respective host plants of a specialized organ, the root nodule. Other symbiotic associations involve heterocystous cyanobacteria, while increasing numbers of nitrogen-fixing species have been identified as colonizing the root surface and, in some cases, the root interior of a variety of cereal crops and pasture grasses. Basic and advanced aspects of these associations are covered in this review.},

  abstract  = {In a split-root system of soybeans (Glycine max L. Merr), inoculation of one half-side suppressed subsequent development of nodules on the opposite side. At zero time, the first side of the split-root system of soybeans received Rhizobium japonicum strain USDA 138 as the primary inoculum. At selected time intervals, the second side was inoculated with the secondary inoculum, a mixture of R. japonicum strain USDA 138 and strain USDA 110. In a short-day season, nodulation by the secondary inoculum was inhibited 100\% when inoculation was delayed 10 days. Nodulation on the second side was significantly suppressed when the secondary inoculum was delayed for only 96 hours. In a long-day season, nodule suppression on the second side was highly significant, but not always 100\%. Nodule suppression on the second side was not related to the appearance of nodules or nitrogenase activity on the side of split-roots which were inoculated at zero time. When the experiments were done under different light intensities, nodule suppression was significantly more pronounced in the shaded treatments.},

  abstract  = {Seven supernodulation mutants of soybean (Glycine max) derived from the cultivar Bragg were investigated for shoot control of the supernodulation response. Reciprocal grafts showed that supernodulation in all lines tested was obtained only if the genotype of the shoot was homozygous for the mutant allele(s). In addition two lines of Korean origin (selected in the field for increased nitrate tolerance) were included in the grafting studies. Under our experimental conditions nitrate tolerance could not be demonstrated in the Korean cultivars. Grafts gave near-control levels of nodulation, suggesting that the genetic basis of nitrate tolerance and increased nodulation in the Korean lines is different from that seen in the induced mutants of Bragg. The data suggest that, contrary to earlier reports with pea (Pisum sativum) mutants, no root control of supernodulation could be demonstrated. Furthermore the results point to a possible novel regulatory system governing nodule numbers and patterning which involves an intertissue transfer of a chemical signal.},

  abstract  = {Soybean (Glycine max) is one of the most important crop plants for seed protein and oil content, and for its capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbioses with soil-borne microorganisms. We sequenced the 1.1-gigabase genome by a whole-genome shotgun approach and integrated it with physical and high-density genetic maps to create a chromosome-scale draft sequence assembly. We predict 46,430 protein-coding genes, 70% more than Arabidopsis and similar to the poplar genome which, like soybean, is an ancient polyploid (palaeopolyploid). About 78% of the predicted genes occur in chromosome ends, which comprise less than one-half of the genome but account for nearly all of the genetic recombination. Genome duplications occurred at approximately 59 and 13 million years ago, resulting in a highly duplicated genome with nearly 75% of the genes present in multiple copies. The two duplication events were followed by gene diversification and loss, and numerous chromosome rearrangements. An accurate soybean genome sequence will facilitate the identification of the genetic basis of many soybean traits, and accelerate the creation of improved soybean varieties.},

  abstract  = {Since NO3− availability in the rooting medium seriously limits symbiotic N2 fixation by soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.), studies were initiated to select nodulation mutants which were more tolerant to NO3− and were adapted to the Midwest area of the United States. Three independent mutants were selected in the M2 generation from ethyl methanesulfonate or N-nitroso-N-methylurea mutagenized Williams seed. All three mutants (designated NOD1-3, NOD2-4, and NOD3-7) were more extensively nodulated (427 to 770 nodules plant−1) than the Williams parent (187 nodules plant−1) under zero-N growth conditions. This provided evidence that the mutational event(s) affected autoregulatory control of nodulation. Moreover, all three mutants were partially tolerant to NO3−; each retained greater acetylene reduction activity when grown hydroponically with 15 millimolar NO3− than did Williams at 1.5 millimolar NO3−. The NO3− tolerance did not appear to be related to an altered ability to take up or metabolize NO3−, based on solution NO3− depletion and on in vivo nitrate reductase assays. Enhanced nodulation appeared to be controlled by the host plant, being consistent across four Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains tested. In general, the mutant lines produced less dry weight than the control, with root dry weights being more affected than shoot dry weights. The nodulation trait has been stable through the M5 generation in all three mutants.},

  abstract  = {The nodule number of leguminous plants is controlled by “autoregulation”, a type of systemic regulation. Although many studies have attempted to identify key substances in this mechanism, none have been identified to date. Previously, we reported that the key substance(s) in this interaction are shoot-synthesized nodulation restricting substance(s) (SNRS), which are contained in the ethanol-soluble medium-polarity fraction of the shoot extract of wild-type soybean cv. Williams82. In the present study, extracts of wild-type soybean were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and SNRS activity was detected in two different HPLC peaks (P-1, P-2) of the ethanol-soluble fraction. The P-1 and P-2 peaks were also found in the phloem sap of wild-type Williams82, but not in the sap of the hyper-nodulation mutant NOD1-3. A comparison of ultraviolet spectra implied that P-1 and P-2 do not contain salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid, spermine or spermidine. Our results suggest that P-1 and P-2 contain two or more SNRS(s), although the purity of peaks P-1 and P-2 is still unclear.},

  abstract  = {Symbiotic nitrogen fixation in nodules of legumes depends on the complex interaction between the legume plant and (Brady)Rhizobium bacteria. Nodule formation and nitrogen fixation are closely regulated by both the host plant and the microsymbiont. Plant mutants with altered symbiotic performance are considered to be useful to gain a better understanding of the plant—microbe interactions in the legume—(Brady)Rhizobium symbiosis (Jacobsen 1984; Carroll et al 1985a, b; Park and Buttery 1988; Duc and Messager 1989; Gremaud and Harper 1989). Recently, Carroll et al. (1985a, b) have isolated the supernodulating mutants of the soybean cv. “Bragg,” which display a very large number of nodules and “nitrate-tolerant-symbiotic” (nts) characteristics. More recently, Gremaud and Harper (1989) have also isolated similar mutants from the soybean cv. “Williams.” These mutants not only provide materials that are useful for investigatings on the interaction in the nodule formation processes but also for agricultural practice. In particular, the nitrate-tolerance of these supernodulating mutants (Carroll et al. 1985b; Gremaud and Harper 1989) is useful for their cultivation in Japan where the level of soil nitrogen in fields is generally high. However, the cultivars previously used for the isolation of these mutants cannot adapt easily in Japanese climate due to different Maturity Group. Therefore, we attempted to isolate mutants with altered symbiotic phenotypes from the soybean cultivar “Enrei,” one of the most common cultivars in Japan. },
